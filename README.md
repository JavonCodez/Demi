# Valentine's Day Asking Site

A cute, interactive website to ask someone to be your Valentine. The "No" button mischievously runs away from the cursor!

## How to Use

1.  **Open the format**:
    *   Simply double-click `index.html` to open it in your web browser.
    *   OR run a local server if you prefer: `npx serve .`

2.  **Customize**:
    *   **Images**: You can replace the SVG in `index.html` with a real photo of you or something they like.
        *   Look for `<svg ... class="main-image">` and replace it with `<img src="your-photo.jpg" class="main-image">`.
    *   **Text**: Change the message in `index.html`.
    *   **Colors**: Edit `root` variables in `style.css` to change the theme.

## Features
*   "No" button evades the mouse cursor.
*   "Yes" button triggers a celebration animation.
*   Responsive design (works on mobile too!).
